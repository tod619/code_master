## Description

A web page that for a web design company. This site is created using a mobile first approach. The site uses JQuery to achive some animations and it uses owl carousel for the team and review sections to have a scrollable carousel effect. The site has an animated sticky navigation menu that darkens the nav bar as the user scrolls down the page which allows the user to view all the options on the menu easier. JQuery is used to implement a smooth scroll effect which cause the page to scroll with a smooth animation when the user clicks on a link in the nav bar.
